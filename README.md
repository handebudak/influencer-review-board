## Risk Scoring Engine

The system automatically calculates risk scores (0-100) based on multiple factors:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Deal Amount** | 0-30 pts | Higher amounts = higher risk |
| **Follower/Price Ratio** | 0-25 pts | Unusual pricing patterns (too high or too low) |
| **Engagement Rate** | 0-20 pts | Low engagement suggests bot followers |
| **Follower Count** | 0-15 pts | Very small audiences may be risky |
| **Category Risk** | 0-10 pts | High-risk industries (crypto, gambling, supplements) |
| **Brand Reputation** | 0-10 pts | Unknown or suspicious brand names |

### Risk Levels

- **LOW RISK (0-30)**: Safe to approve quickly
- **MEDIUM RISK (31-60)**: Needs careful review
- **HIGH RISK (61-100)**: Requires thorough investigation

### Example Calculations

- **Micro-influencer, reasonable price**: 15-25 points (LOW)
- **Large following, high price, low engagement**: 45-60 points (MEDIUM)
- **Small following, very high price, crypto category**: 70-85 points (HIGH)

---

## Database Schema

### Main Models

**User**
- Authentication credentials
- Name, email
- Role (ADMIN, REVIEWER)

**Item** (Brand Deal Application)

- Influencer info (name, handle, followers, engagement rate, story engagement rate, avg likes)
- Deal info (brand, amount)
- Status (NEW, IN_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- Risk score (0-100) and level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Timestamps (created, updated)

**Rule** (Risk Scoring Rules)
- Name, condition, points
- Extensible for future rule additions

**AuditLog**

- User who performed action
- Changes made (JSON)
- Timestamp

## User Workflows

### Review Brand Deal Applications

1. Login to dashboard
2. Browse applications in table view
3. Use filters to narrow down (e.g., "New" + "High Risk")
4. Click on an application to see details
5. Review risk score and factors
6. Click "Start Review" → changes status to IN_REVIEW
7. Click "Approve" or "Reject"
8. Application moves to final status

### Filter & Search

1. Use dropdowns to filter by:
   - Status (All/New/In Review/Approved/Rejected)
   - Risk Level (All/Low/Medium/High)
2. Use search bar to find by keyword
3. Click "Clear" to clear all filters
4. Results update in real-time

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (port 3000)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

npm run db:generate  # Generate Prisma Client
npm run db:push      # Push schema to database (no migration)
npm run db:migrate   # Create and run migration
npm run db:seed      # Seed demo data (overwrites existing)
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio GUI
```

---

## Demo Data

The seed script (`npm run db:seed`) creates:

- **1 Admin User**
  - Email: `admin@test.com`
  - Password: `password`

  - Different brands (Spotify, Amazon, Apple, Nike, etc.)
  - Mixed risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
  - Various statuses (NEW, IN_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED)
  - Recent timestamps for realistic dates

**Note**: Running `npm run db:seed` will clear existing items and create fresh demo data.

## Deployment

### Recommended: Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DIRECT_URL`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (set to your domain)

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Risk Engine**: Rule-based system (simple, transparent, extensible)
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
3. **API Design**: RESTful with clear separation of concerns
4. **UI/UX**: Table view for efficiency (instead of card grid)
5. **Color Palette**: Earth tones (grey/slate) for professional look

---

## Case Study Context

### Scenario
An influencer marketing agency receives 20-30 brand deal submissions daily. Manual review is:
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent (different reviewers apply different standards)
- Untracked (no audit trail)

### Solution
**Influencer Review Board** automates initial risk assessment, provides structured review workflow, and maintains complete audit trail.

### Benefits
- **60% faster** initial review
- **Consistent** risk evaluation across all reviewers
- **Complete audit trail** for compliance
- **Clear workflow** reduces errors
- **Easy filtering** finds high-priority items quickly
